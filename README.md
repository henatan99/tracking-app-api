## Getting Started

**This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.**
**Modify this file to match your project, remove sections that don't apply. For example: delete the testing section if the currect project doesn't require testing.**


To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites
`Ruby` | `Rails` | `postgresql`
### Setup
- git clone git@github.com:henatan99/tracking-app-api.git
- run `bundle install` 
- run `db:migrate`
- Once project is implemented 
### Install
- `bundle install`
### Usage
- User requests from front end. Many of the requests require user_login through JWT authentication.

        measurement.id == measured.measurement_id
      end
      @measureds_by_measurement.push(filtered) if filtered
    end
    # json_response(@measureds_by_measurement)
    render json: { measureds_by_measurement: @measureds_by_measurement, goals: @user.goals }
